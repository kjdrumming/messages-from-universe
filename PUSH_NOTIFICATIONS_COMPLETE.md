# üîî Push Notification System - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What's Been Fixed

### 1. **Removed SMS, Focus on Push Notifications**
- Eliminated all SMS/Twilio functionality
- Streamlined to only handle push notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
- Updated database schema to only include `push_token` field

### 2. **Improved Time Matching Logic**
- **Before**: 1-minute window (too strict)
- **After**: 5-minute window (accounts for cron timing delays)
- Better timezone handling and user local time calculation

### 3. **Enhanced Edge Function**
- `send-scheduled-notifications/index.ts` now properly:
  - Gets users with `notification_enabled = true`
  - Calculates their local time based on timezone
  - Checks if current time matches their `notification_time` (¬±5 minutes)
  - Sends push notifications via FCM
  - Records sent messages to prevent duplicates (1 per day limit)

### 4. **Database Schema Updates**
- Added `push_token` field to `customer_users` table
- Created migration file: `supabase/migrations/add_phone_notifications.sql`
- Added proper indexing for performance

## üîß How It Works Now

1. **Cron Job** calls `/cron-trigger` every minute
2. **Cron Trigger** calls `/send-scheduled-notifications`
3. **Notification Function**:
   - Gets all users with notifications enabled
   - For each user, converts current UTC time to their timezone
   - If their local time matches their preferred notification time (¬±5 minutes):
     - Selects a random motivational message
     - Sends push notification via FCM
     - Records in database to prevent duplicates

## üöÄ Setup Requirements

### Environment Variables (Supabase)
```
FCM_SERVER_KEY=your_firebase_cloud_messaging_server_key
```

### Database Requirements
Users need:
- `notification_enabled = true`
- `notification_time` (e.g., '09:00:00')
- `timezone` (IANA format: 'America/New_York')
- `push_token` (FCM token from mobile app)

### Cron Job Setup
Set up a cron job to call every minute:
```
POST https://your-project-ref.supabase.co/functions/v1/cron-trigger
```

## üß™ Testing

Run the test script:
```bash
./test-notifications.sh
```

This will:
- Test all edge functions
- Force send notifications to all eligible users
- Test the cron trigger mechanism
- Verify the scheduled notification logic

## üì± Frontend Integration Needed

Your mobile app needs to:
1. Initialize Firebase/FCM
2. Request notification permission
3. Get FCM token
4. Save token to user's `push_token` field
5. Handle token refresh

## üîç Monitoring

Check Supabase Function logs to see:
- User processing
- Time matching logic
- Push notification success/failures
- Error messages

## üö® Troubleshooting

### No Notifications Sent
- Verify `FCM_SERVER_KEY` is set
- Check users have `notification_enabled = true`
- Verify timezone format (use IANA names)
- Check cron job is running

### Notifications Not Received
- Verify push tokens are valid
- Check user granted notification permission
- Ensure FCM project configured correctly
- Check device notification settings

The system is now ready for automatic push notifications! The main requirement is setting up the FCM server key and a reliable cron job to trigger the notifications every minute.
